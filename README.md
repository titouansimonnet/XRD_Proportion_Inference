# Deep neural network method for mineral phases quantification using XRD patterns

## Abstract
We propose a method to quantify the mineral phases of a material sample using the X-Ray diffraction patterns. 
This is a two steps method. We first train a Neural Network (NN) using synthetic data. 
Then, recovering the trained NN we are able to test the method with 32 experimental data.
